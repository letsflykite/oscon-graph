At http://neo4j.org[Neo4j], we love going to

This year, there is a http://www.oscon.com/oscon2014/public/content/schedulefeed[DYI Schedule page] that we are very intrigued by, so let's build a -- graph of the conference!

== Quick Install

run `scripts/doit.sh` to

* download jq for your platform `scripts/install_jq.sh`
* load the OSCON JSON feed `scripts/load_feed.sh`
* create the 3 csv files for venues, speakers and events using jq `scripts/create_csv.sh`
* insert the data into neo4j using your locally running neo4j instance on +http://localhost:7474+ `scripts/insert_data.sh`

The following is also detailed in the http://www.neo4j.org/graphgist?github-neo4j-examples%2Foscon-graph%2F%2Foscon_graphgist.adoc[GraphGist]

== The Model

We are followingthe model of the data closely and are just using three different labels for the nodes, `Venue`, `Speaker` and `Event`:

== The Data

First, we download the excellent http://stedolan.github.io/jq/[JQ] utility, it's a single binary, in my case I downloaded it to my current directory, `./jq`. Now, the http://www.oscon.com/oscon2014[OSCON] organizers are so awesome to publish the full schedule as a JSON feed from the http://www.oscon.com/oscon2014/public/content/schedulefeed[OSCON website] - thank you! We can parse this directly from the feed via `curl` and `jq` and pipe the the resulting lines into 3 different CSV files for Neo4j import.

It turns out that the conference has over 350 speakers, 53 venues and 470+ talks!

=== The JSON feed

The data feed can be downloaded and looks something like 

[source,json]
----
{ "Schedule": {
    "conferences": [{"serial": 115 }],
    "events": [
    
      {
        "serial": 33451,
        "name": "Migrating to the Web Using Dart and Polymer - A Guide for Legacy OOP Developers",
        "event_type": "40-minute conference session",
        
        "time_start": "2014-07-23 17:00:00",
        "time_stop": "2014-07-23 17:40:00",
        "venue_serial": 1458,
        "description": "The web development platform is massive.

        "website_url": "http://oscon.com/oscon2014/public/schedule/detail/33451", 
        "speakers": [149868],
        "categories": [
        
          "Emerging Languages"
        
        ]
      },
...

=== The model

We are very pragmatic in this little post and define just three node Labels: `Venue`, `Speaker` and `Event`, following the OSCON data structure:

image::http://yuml.me/diagram/scruffy/class/[Speaker%7C+serial+;+twitter+]-SPEAKS_AT-0..*%3E[Event%7C+serial+],[Event]-AT_VENUE%3E[Venue%7C+serial+].png[]

=== JSON -> CSV

Now, using the awesome `jq` utility, we can easily filter out the relevant bits for our import, most notably the serial numbers of `event`, `venue` and `speaker` which then are cross-referenced in the various parts. We also add a header line to each CSV file for convenience.


[source,bash]
----
include:data/create_csv.sh[]
----

Resulting in e.g. a `speaker.csv`, `venues.csv` and `events.csv` in your data directory.

A you can see, in the last case, we have to make sure the empty values, empty arrays and serialization into a parseable string from an integer array are taken care of in `jq`, resulting in the gnarly `.speakers | if (. | type) == "null" then "" else (. | tostring | ltrimstr("[") | rtrimstr("]")) end]` construct. Still, it's three one-liners and at least for me impressively compact and readable, resulting in files like event.json:

Now we have nicely formatted `CSV` files with headers that we can import into Neo4j.


== The Import

From here, there is built-in support in the standard http://docs.neo4j.org/chunked/stable/cypher-query-lang.html[Neo4j Cypher language] for importing files. Loading venues and speakers is just a matter of iterating over the lines and using http://docs.neo4j.org/chunked/stable/cypher-query-lang.html[LOAD CSV]:

[source,cypher]
----
LOAD CSV WITH headers FROM "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/neo4j-examples/oscon-graph/master/data/speakers.csv" as line
CREATE (speaker:Speaker{serial:line.serial, name:line.name, photo:line.photo, twitter:line.twitter})
----

[source,cypher]
----
LOAD CSV WITH headers FROM "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/neo4j-examples/oscon-graph/master/data/venues.csv" as line
CREATE (speaker:Venue{serial:line.serial, name:line.name})
----


For the events, it is a bit more involved since one event can have several speakers. We are thus creating one `venue`

[source,cypher]
----
LOAD CSV WITH headers FROM "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/neo4j-examples/oscon-graph/master/data/events.csv" as line
MATCH  (venue: Venue{serial:line.venue_serial})
CREATE (event:Event{serial:line.serial, name:line.name, time_start: line.time_start, time_end: line.time_end, type:line.event_type})-[:AT_VENUE]->(venue)
FOREACH (category_name in split(line.categories,"|") | MERGE (category:Category {name:category_name}) CREATE (event)-[:IN_CATEGORY]->(category))
WITH event, line
WHERE line.speakers <> "" 
UNWIND split(line.speakers, ",") as speaker_serial
MATCH (speaker:Speaker{serial:speaker_serial})
CREATE (event)<-[:SPEAKS_AT]-(speaker)
